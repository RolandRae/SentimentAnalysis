# Sentiment Analysis

Here are the scripts and files for the sentiment analysis of Mark Twain that was completed for a University of Tartu thesis project. The aim of the thesis was to analyse five books written by Mark Twain and compare sentiment distribution and possible interpretations of such data. 

The script was written by Roland Rae. Additional credit goes to thesis supervisors Jane Klavan and Artjoms Å ela. This was a magnificent and challenging project. Thank you for all the help.
